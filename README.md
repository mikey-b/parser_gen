# parser_gen

parser_gen will generate a LL with backtracking Parser from a description written in xml.

Currently only a javascript parser is generated.

#Future
While the parser is fairly quick already, Plans to make this a LL(*) parser, a look-ahead parser with a fixed look-ahead, seems like a good idea. The current XML definition is good enough to generate a LL(1) parser.

Finish other outputs such as C++, and D.
